\section{Notes}{
 These data were collected by Patrick Tulloch, an MSU economics major, for a term project. The “athletic success” variables are for the year prior to the enrollment and academic data. Updating these data to get a longer stretch of years, and including appearances in the “Sweet 16” NCAA basketball tournaments, would make for a more convincing analysis. With the growing popularity of women’s sports, especially basketball, an analysis that includes success in women’s athletics would be interesting.
