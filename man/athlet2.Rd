\section{Notes}{
 These data were collected by Paul Anderson, an MSU economics major, for a term project. The score from football outcomes for natural rivals (Michigan-Michigan State, California-Stanford, Florida-Florida State, to name a few) is matched with application and academic data. The application and tuition data are for Fall 1994. Football records and scores are from 1993 football season. Extended these data to obtain a long stretch of panel data and other “natural” rivals could be very interesting.
