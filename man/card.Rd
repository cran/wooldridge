\section{Notes}{
 Computer Exercise C15.3 is important for analyzing these data. There, it is shown that the instrumental variable, `nearc4`, is actually correlated with `IQ`, at least for the subset of men for which an IQ score is reported. However, the correlation between `nearc4`` and `IQ`, once the other explanatory variables are netted out, is arguably zero. At least, it is not statistically different from zero. In other words, `nearc4` fails the exogeneity requirement in a simple regression model but it passes, at least using the crude test described above, if controls are added to the wage equation. For a more advanced course, a nice extension of Card's analysis is to allow the return to education to differ by race. A relatively simple extension is to include black education (blackeduc) as an additional explanatory variable; its natural instrument is blacknearc4.
