\description{
Wooldridge Source: These data were collected by David Dicicco, a former MSU undergraduate, for a final project. They came from various issues of the County and City Data Book, and are for the years 1982 and 1985. Unfortunately, I do not have the list of cities. Data loads lazily.

\section{Notes}{
 Very rich crime data sets, at the county, or even city, level, can be collected using the FBIâ€™s Uniform Crime Reports. These data can be matched up with demographic and economic data, at least for census years. The County and City Data Book contains a variety of statistics, but the years do not always match up. These data sets can be used investigate issues such as the effects of casinos on city or county crime rates.
