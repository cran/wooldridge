\section{Notes}{
 Starting in 1995, the Michigan Department of Education stopped reporting average teacher benefits along with average salary. This data set includes both variables, at the school level, and can be used to study the salary-benefits tradeoff, as in Chapter 4. There are a few suspicious benefits/salary ratios, and so this data set makes a good illustration of the impact of outliers in Chapter 9.
