\section{Notes}{
 (1) Much more recent data can be obtained from the National Opinion Research Center website, http://www.norc.org/GSS+Website/Download/. Very rich pooled cross sections can be constructed to study a variety of issues – not just changes in fertility over time. It would be interesting to analyze a similar data set for a developing country, especially where efforts have been made to emphasize birth control. Some measure of access to birth control could be useful if it varied by region. Sometimes, one can find policy changes in the advertisement or availability of contraceptives.
