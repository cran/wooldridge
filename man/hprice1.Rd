\section{Notes}{
 Typically, it is very easy to obtain data on selling prices and characteristics of homes, using publicly available data bases. It is interesting to match the information on houses with other information – such as local crime rates, quality of the local schools, pollution levels, and so on – and estimate the effects of such variables on housing prices.
