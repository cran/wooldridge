Diego Garcia, a former Ph.D. student in economics at MIT, kindly provided these data, which he obtained from the book Regression Diagnostics: Identifying Influential Data and Sources of Collinearity, by D.A. Belsey, E. Kuh, and R. Welsch, 1990. New York: Wiley. Data loads lazily.

\section{Notes}{
 The census contains rich information on variables such as median housing prices, median income levels, average family size, and so on, for fairly small geographical areas. If such data can be merged with pollution data, one can update the Harrison and Rubinfeld study. Presumably, this has been done in academic journals.
