Professor Tobias kindly provided the data, which were obtained from the 1991 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. All people in the sample are males age 26 to 34. For confidentiality reasons, I have included only a subset of the variables used by the authors. Data loads lazily.

\section{Notes}{
 Because an ability measure is included in this data set, it can be used as another illustration of including proxy variables in regression models. See Chapter 9. Also, one can try the IV procedure with the ability measure included as an exogenous explanatory variable.
