Wooldridge Source: T.J. Kane and C.E. Rouse (1995), Labor-Market Returns to Two- and Four-Year Colleges, American Economic Review 85, 600-614. With Professor Rouseâ€™s kind assistance, I obtained the data from her web site at Princeton University. Data loads lazily.

\section{Notes}{
 As possible extensions, students can explore whether the returns to two-year or four-year colleges depend on race or gender. This is partly done in Problem 7.9 but where college is aggregated into one number. Also, should experience appear as a quadratic in the wage specification?
