\section{Notes}{
 Barry Murphy, of the University of Portsmouth in the UK, has pointed out that for several observations the values for exper and tenure are in logical conflict. In particular, for some workers the number of years with current employer (tenure) is greater than overall work experience (exper). At least some of these conflicts are due to the definition of exper as “potential” work experience, but probably not all. Nevertheless, I am using the data set as it was supplied to me.
